This is the code and data needed to reproduce the figures in the following
paper:

"Dual-scan acquisition for accelerated continuous-wave EPR oximetry". Jason
Palmer, Lee C Potter, David H Johnson, Jay L Zweier, Rizwan Ahmad. Accepted for
publication in the Journal of Magnetic Resonance, 2012.

The latest version of this code can be found at

You can see the figures produced by the code at

(Please see the paper for our final edited versions.)

- Instructions -----------------------------------------------------------------

To reproduce the desired figure, call the corresponding function (e.g. figure_2)
in MATLAB (or octave). This will produce the figure in a new figure window and
save it as an EPS file (e.g. figure_2.eps).

- Notes ------------------------------------------------------------------------

The figures produced may require significant post-processing in order to look
presentable. I recommend inkscape for that.

I don't use the latex interpreter for drawing on the plots because its
correctness varies wildly between operating systems.

Production of some figures requires MATLAB's optimization toolbox. (If you use
octave, no non-core functions are required.)
