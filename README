This is the MATLAB code and data needed to reproduce the figures in the
following paper:

"Dual-scan acquisition for accelerated continuous-wave EPR oximetry". Jason
Palmer, Lee C. Potter, David H. Johnson, Jay L. Zweier, Rizwan Ahmad. Submitted
to the Journal of Magnetic Resonance in 2012.

- Instructions -----------------------------------------------------------------

To reproduce the desired figure, run the corresponding script (e.g. figure_2.m)
in MATLAB. This will produce the figure in a new figure window and save it as an
EPS file (e.g. figure_2.eps).

- Notes ------------------------------------------------------------------------

The figures produced may require significant post-processing in order to look
presentable. I recommend inkscape for that.

I don't use the latex interpreter for drawing on the plots because its
correctness varies wildly between operating systems.

Production of some figures may require MATLAB's optimization toolbox.

This code has been verified to work on MATLAB versions 2010b and 2011b.
