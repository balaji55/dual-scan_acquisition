Finish octave compatibility. This will involve a little bit of conditional
code--one block for MATLAB and one block for octave--in a few files.

Consider scilab compatibility as well. This would involve separate files for
scilab. There is a MATLAB->scilab code conversion tool that could do a lot of
the work.
