Test all files under as many versions of MATLAB as I can find:

	figure_1.m: 2010b, 2011b
	figure_2.m: 2010b, 2011b
	figure_3.m: 2010b, 2011b
	figure_4.m: 2010b, 2011b
	figure_5.m: 
	figure_6.m: 
	figure_7.m: 

Consider octave and scilab compatibility as well. We would need separate files
for scilab, since the comment syntax differs. Maybe a separate set of files for
each program would be best.
