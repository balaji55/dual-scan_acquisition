Test all files under as many versions of MATLAB as I can find:

	figure_1.m: 2010b, 2011b
	figure_2.m: 2010b, 2011b
	figure_3.m: 2011b
	figure_4.m: 2011b

Consider octave and scilab compatibility as well. We would have to have separate
files for scilab, since the comment syntax differs. Maybe a separate file for
each program would be best.
