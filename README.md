## Instructions

To reproduce the desired figure, call the corresponding function (e.g.
`figure_2`) in MATLAB or Octave. This will produce the figure in a new figure
window and save it as an EPS file (e.g. `figure_2.eps`).

Production of some figures requires MATLAB's optimization toolbox or Octave's
optim package.


## Results

The figures produced by running this code in MATLAB 2011b are shown below. (No
post-processing has been done. See the paper for the final edited versions.)
